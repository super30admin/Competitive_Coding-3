# Problem 1:
# https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:

0 <= i, j < nums.length
i != j
nums[i] - nums[j] == k
Notice that |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

# Problem 2:
# https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it
