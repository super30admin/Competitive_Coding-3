    Did this code successfully run on LeetCode?:
        Yes

    Problems faced while coding this:
        None

    Approach:
        Two Pointer approach
        Start i and j pointers at 0th index.
        At any instance:
            -> If i and j are equal, move j ahead.
            -> Else if the diff of num at j and num at i is less than k,
                this means that we want a bigger number, so move j ahead.
            -> Else if the diff between these two is greater than,
                this means that we want a smaller number, so move i ahead.
            -> Else, the diff should be equal to k.
                Increment count and move both i and j ahead.
                You have to make sure that num at j != num at j - 1 to avoid duplicate pairs.
                If it is the case, move j ahead until this condition is satisfied.
